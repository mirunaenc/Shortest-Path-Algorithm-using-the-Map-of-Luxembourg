# Shortest-Path-Algorithm-using-the-Map-of-Luxembourg

## Project Description
This project aims to find the shortest paths to all exits in a maze using breadth-first search (BFS). The maze is read from a file and transformed into a graph, with the entry point specified either through user input or from the file. Exit points are represented by '1' values at the maze's edges. The application features a graphical interface where walls, paths, entry points, discovered paths, and inaccessible exits are visually distinguished.

## Technologies Used
Java, Swing
